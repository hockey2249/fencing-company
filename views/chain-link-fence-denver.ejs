		<p>Chain-link is the most widely used fence system in today's industrial, commercial and residential fence markets. Chain link allows a clear view, with no place for intruders to hide.<p>

		<p>Traditional, metallic-coated chain-link fence remains one of the most effective, economical fencing barriers on the market today and is the number one selling fence system in the world. Chain-link fence is known for its strength and durability and has provided the most cost-effective way to protect children, control pets and safeguard commercial property and assets in both suburban and urban settings.<p>

		<p>There is a continued growing interest in color for residential applications. Color coating gives a smoother finish, prevents rusting, and helps the installation blend into surroundings. Black is the most popular, because it is often close to being invisible; green and brown are also frequent choices. Various types of slats that add privacy or soften the look of chain link or otherwise customize an installation continue to grow in popularity for residential and nonresidential applications.</p>
